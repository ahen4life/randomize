# Randomize! #

Hi! This project aims at giving basic hexa code for a random color. Just click on the dice and get any color from the hexa range, starting with a #! Hope you like it!

Btw, don't ever hesitate to pull requests, I'm open to everything. especially to better code! Also you can add a comment below and I'll be happy to chat!

Cheers!
